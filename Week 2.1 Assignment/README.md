This week was surprisingly simple -- I decided quickly I didn't want things to be as the same as everyone else, and decided to create an image with a group of squares that would build over each other, each with different colors and growing in size.
The entire project was fairly simple to create, though the variable's placement in the script was a little difficult to make sure the correct variables were being recreated.
In all honesty, this took only about an hour, where as PacMan took about two hours. I thought this would be harder, but it was actually simpler.
