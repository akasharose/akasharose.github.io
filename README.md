For my final project, I aim to make a collection based, simplistic game with the same level of complexity of the first Mario game.

The game (we'll call it Box Game for now) will have the player moving around a static arena, collecting boxes. The boxes will have a number of spots on each given map they can spawn, meaning that every run of the game will be slightly different. Depending on the difficulty selected, there will be a different goal for number of boxes, as well as an 'endless' mode, where there is no goal.

The challenge comes from the enemies -- there will be a number of spawn points in the arena, and an enemy will spawn randomly at a point whenever a timer expires. The enemies cannot be killed, and will follow one of a few randomized AI's -- they'll either wander randomly, move through a path, or directly chase after the player. Every box the player collects lowers the length of the timer, and the enemies spawn more frequently, eventually filling the entire screen with unkillable chaos.

First, I'll create the arenas, and program a player. I'll make the player walk around, and ensure everything is working. Next, I add in the boxes, and goals. Once all of that works, I go into the more difficult side of things -- the enemies.

I'll comment out the player and the boxes, and build the simpler of the two AIs first -- the random and the pre-planned path. The pre-planned path will be the simpler, as it will be a simple group of code that is just run in a loop. An actual following AI will definitely be more difficult.

Once I've developed everything, I'll drop them all in, and then likely cry at how broken it is. Once I've recomposed myself, I'll work out bugs to focus on making the entire game work.

The difficulty will come from making the movements and AI run smoothly. I have no doubt I can build the character, but the enemies and the box collection are where things will get significantly more difficult. I may end up visiting quite a bit as I try to put what is, to me, a massive undertaking.
