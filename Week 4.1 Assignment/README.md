This week, I decided I would clean up my Week 3.2 Assignment -- it was difficult to read, and difficult to understand. I spent nearly three hours figuring out how to simply and effectively eliminate unnecessary variables and statements.

The first things I did were going in and simplifying the color randomization. By having the same function be called in both setup and in mousePressed, I was able to eliminate all six of the color variables, instead creating a two line function that would change the background and fill colors. Doing this cleaned the code up at a rapid rate -- from there, I removed the createSquares boolean, and instead just made the program create squares whenever it wasn't making circles. This did slightly complicate the shape building process, as it created another if/else statement inside the already complicated for loop. I tried to come up with a simplifier, but was unsuccessful in coming up with anything that didn't just make the shapes function more complicated.

I then continued cleaning things up -- at the end of the day, I cut nearly thirty lines of code, and simplified everything. In addition, I set up the for loops to be based directly on the canvas size, so that the canvas can be changed, and the for statements will create shapes to always cover the entire canvas. Personally, I like this code of the same project so much more than the first. Just looking at them back to back is amazing -- functions are my new best friend.
