# Marcus Milyko Blog Post Week 1.1

This actually went surprisingly well. On Monday, I had no idea what was going on (What is git? Why is git? P5? Is this reality?), but after trying to figure out all of what's going on, I started to catch back up.

I decided to make Pac-Man, having just eaten a ghost, eating some orbs. It's fairly simple, and I figured it'd be something that would take time, but wouldn't be too convoluted. I think it turned out alright.

It took me somewhere around an hour, and the hardest part was making the ghost's two eye cricles interact the way I wanted them to, as well as finding the peach color I was looking for to make Pac-Man's orbs look alright.

Looking at this upcoming assignment, I MIGHT just end up popping in for help sometime later in the week...

Here's to me not failing the class!

#edit -- upon further investigation, I find that, although I can get the link to the sketch no issue, I can't seem to get the link to this up for the life of me. I'm posting the md file it says I'm connecting to, and ask you about it tomorrow!
