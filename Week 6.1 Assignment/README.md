This week was massively difficult. Even while creating my project for this, I had to change ideas and concepts multiple times, to an almost exhausting amount. My intial thought was to create a class of moving objects (like the SadFace example), and then allow them to be interacted with in the same way our bricks example was.

First, I created my circles class, setting a number of variables that nearly matched SadFace. Within an hour and a half of messing with the code and fixing bugs, I had gotten a number of circles to move around the canvas, bouncing off the walls and all. I added in the ability to start in a random direction from the starting position and everything sorted out fairly well to begin.

The next challenge was creating the ability to click on the circles to change something. I focused on creating a color change first, and had to try almost four or five times before I realized exactly where I should link all my class functions and such to keep everything running.

Adding the dissapearence of the circles was easy. I just added an else, a visible variable, and created a boolean array to allow me to change the chance of dissapearance would be -- but creating the trueFalse variable as [true, true, true, false], I was able to give the circles a 25% chance of dissapearing with every click, which was about what I wanted. Next up was the reset button.

Creating the button in relation to my height was simple, but despite how much i tried, I couldn't figure out a way to allow for the circles to bounce off of the button as well -- if we could discuss ways to do that (I feel like we had discussed it before), that would be wonderful.

From there, everything was troubleshooting and smooth riding!
